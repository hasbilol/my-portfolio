# Portfolio Knowledge Base

**Note:** This markdown file is for reference. The actual knowledge base used by the chatbot is in `knowledge.js`.

To update the chatbot's knowledge about you:
1. Edit `worker/knowledge.js`
2. Replace the template content with your actual information
3. Redeploy the worker

The `knowledge.js` file exports a string that contains all information about you that the chatbot will use to answer questions.
